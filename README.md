# Spam_Email_Filter

Description:
This spam email filter project leverages machine learning to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails. Using a dataset of emails, the project employs several data preprocessing steps, feature extraction techniques, and machine learning algorithms to train a model capable of accurately identifying spam emails.

Technologies Used:
- Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
- Google Colab: For interactive code development and project documentation.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning model, including data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

Project Components:
- Data Preprocessing
- Cleansing and normalizing text data.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Feature Extraction
- Using TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into a format suitable for machine learning model.
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Training the machine learning model to identify an effective approach.
- Testing the model on the divided test set.
